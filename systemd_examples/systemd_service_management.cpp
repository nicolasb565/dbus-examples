/* Dbus bus can be monitored and the api(s) are also discoverable.
 * For this example, we want to be able to start and stop service using systemd dbus api.
 * I used the command "sudo busctl monitor" while from another shell I sent the command "sudo systemctl"
 * I observed the following from busctl:

 * The list of method and signals is very long, but we see here that StartUnit and StopUnit are probably what we are looking for
 * 
 * I know from looking at output from systemctl that cups (common unix printing service) is running, but I really do not care because I have no printer
 * It is unfortunate that there is not more documentation about the args for now, would either need to use systemctl while monitoring or look at documentation from systemd
 * I tried monitoring command "sudo systemctl stop cups" but I do not see any use of StopUnit and the whole thing is very chatty and convoluted
 * Documentation from systemd says the folowing:
 * 
 * StartUnit() enqueues a start job and possibly depending jobs.
 * It takes the unit to activate and a mode string as arguments.
 * The mode needs to be one of "replace", "fail", "isolate", "ignore-dependencies", or "ignore-requirements".
 * If "replace", the method will start the unit and its dependencies, possibly replacing already queued jobs that conflict with it.
 * If "fail", the method will start the unit and its dependencies, but will fail if this would change an already queued job.
 * If "isolate", the method will start the unit in question and terminate all units that aren't dependencies of it.
 * If "ignore-dependencies", it will start a unit but ignore all its dependencies.
 * If "ignore-requirements", it will start a unit but only ignore the requirement dependencies.
 * It is not recommended to make use of the latter two options.
 * On reply, if successful, this method returns the newly created job object which has been enqueued for asynchronous activation.
 * Callers that want to track the outcome of the actual start operation need to monitor the result of this job.
 * This can be achieved in a race-free manner by first subscribing to the JobRemoved() signal, then calling StartUnit() 
 * and using the returned job object to filter out unrelated JobRemoved() signals, until the desired one is received, which will then carry the result of the start operation.
 * StopUnit() is similar to StartUnit() but stops the specified unit rather than starting it. Note that the "isolate" mode is invalid for this method.
 * 
 * Let's try those StartUnit and StopUnit methods from the command line using busctl
 * After having tried "sudo systemctl stop cups", I need to start cups again:
 * sudo busctl call org.freedesktop.systemd1 /org/freedesktop/systemd1 org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager StartUnit ss cups.service replace 
o "/org/freedesktop/systemd1/job/3506"
 * 
 * I observe cups is now running in systemctl, let's try the StopUnit method now
 * 
 * sudo busctl call org.freedesktop.systemd1 /org/freedesktop/systemd1 org.freedesktop.systemd1.Manager StopUnit ss cups.service replace 
o "/org/freedesktop/systemd1/job/3607"
 * 
 * I no longer see cups in systemctl, so this is working
 * 
 * Knowing this, I wrote the following C program to start cups, then sleep until we get sigint or sigterm and stop cups before exiting.
 * Note this program need to be run as root to have required permission to start/stop services.
 * If this is not the case, I would probably have to use policykit to ask for additional permissions,
 * and enduser would typicaly get prompted to enter login credentials
 * 
 * I used the command "systemctl is-active cups" to see if this program start and stop cups service
